Sauron is a minimalistic cross-platform malware scanner with non-blocking realtime filesystem monitoring using YARA rules, written in Rust.

## Building

```sh
cargo build --release
```

### Dependencies

Your system must have `libssl-dev` installed. For Ubuntu-derivatives this can be installed via `sudo apt install libssl-dev`. 

## Running 

Assuming you have your YARA rules in `./yara-rules` (you can find [plenty of free rules](https://github.com/InQuest/awesome-yara) online):

```sh
sudo ./target/release/sauron --rules ./yara-rules
```

## Single Scan

Alternatively you can perform a one-time recursive scan of the specified folder using the `--scan` argument:

```sh
sudo ./target/release/sauron --rules ./yara-rules --scan --root /path/to/scan
```

You can specify which file extensions to scan (all by default) with the `--ext` argument:

```sh
sudo ./target/release/sauron \
    --rules ./yara-rules \
    --scan \
    --root /path/to/scan \
    --ext exe \
    --ext elf \
    --ext doc \
    --ext docx
```

## Reporting

Various options are available for reporting:

* `--report-clean` will also report clean files.
* `--report-errors` explicitly report errors (reported as debug logs by default).
* `--report-output <FILENAME>` will write scan reports to a file.
* `--report-json` if `--report-output` is passed, write as JSON instead of text.

Run `sauron --help` for the complete list of options.
