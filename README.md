Sauron is a minimalistic cross-platform malware scanner with non-blocking realtime filesystem monitoring using YARA rules, written in Rust.

## Building

```sh
cargo build --release
```

## Running 

Assuming you have your YARA rules in `./yara-rules` (you can find [plenty](https://github.com/elastic/protections-artifacts) of [free rules](https://github.com/Yara-Rules/rules) online):

```sh
sudo ./target/release/sauron --rules ./yara-rules
```

## Single Scan

Alternatively you can perform a one-time recursive scan of the specified folder:

```sh
sudo ./target/release/sauron --rules ./yara-rules --scan --root /path/to/scan
```

You can specify which file extensions to scan (all by default) with the `--ext` argument:

```sh
sudo ./target/release/sauron --rules ./yara-rules --scan --root /path/to/scan --ext exe --ext elf --ext doc --ext docx
```
